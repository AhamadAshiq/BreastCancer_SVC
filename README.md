This Jupyter notebook implements a breast cancer detection model using Support Vector Classification (SVC). The notebook includes the following key steps:

Data Preparation:

Loading the Data: The dataset is imported and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Splitting the Data: The data is divided into training and testing sets using train_test_split to evaluate the model's performance.
Feature Scaling:

Standardization: The features are scaled to standardize the data distribution, ensuring that the SVC model performs optimally.
Model Training:

Support Vector Classification (SVC): The SVC model is trained on the standardized training data to classify breast cancer cases.
Model Evaluation:

Accuracy Score: The model’s accuracy is calculated to assess its overall performance.
Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is generated to evaluate the model’s performance in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Classification Report: A detailed classification report is provided, including precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for a comprehensive evaluation of the model.
The notebook demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a machine learning model for breast cancer detection, using standard practices for preprocessing, training, and assessing model performance.
